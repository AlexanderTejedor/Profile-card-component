## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Super cool challenge! I actually had a lot of trouble positioning the two circles in the HTML. I looked for inspiration and even asked in forums until finally, in one of the other developers' challenges, I came across a comment by @danielmrz-dev as feedback to a developer. It surprised me; I didn't know you could put more than two images as a background and even position them from there. Here, I share the code snippet, and many thanks to @danielmrz-dev for that contribution!!!

```css
body{
    position: relative;
    background-color: var(--dark-cyan);
    background-image: url("./assets/images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("./assets/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");
    background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
    background-position: right 52vw bottom 35vh, left 48vw top 52vh;
}
```

### Continued development

Applying this new knowledge with the background game will be very helpful in improving and completing more challenges that require this type of solution.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me to use external fonts instead of local ones, so that everyone can identify the type of font I used for this challenge.
